# Think before read

I love this feeling: when you've read a title or a few first lines of an article, and even before you've got to the critical part, you already know what it is about, or, if there is a problem, you can even find a solution for it by yourself, and it could even be better than the one you'll read later in this, yet unread, article.

The latest example of such experience was [this post](http://www.shiningrocksoftware.com/?p=1303) on for the game [Banished](*banished "Still in development, made by only one person; recommend you to read and subscribe to the [blog](http://www.shiningrocksoftware.com/) — author explains a lot of things on how he comes with different solutions"). If you'd think on this, its rather logical to show the menu as fast as possible and to preload the latest savegame in background. And it's a great solution to show the scene from this latest save as a background for the main menu. And opening this save game would be instant and would mean just a slight transition from the main menu to the game interface.
