# Think before read

I love this feeling: when you've read a title or a few first lines of an article, and even before you've got to the critical part, you already know what it is about, or, if there is a problem, you can even find a solution for it by yourself, and it could even be better than the one you'll read later in this, yet unread, article.

The latest example of such experience was [this post](https://www.shiningrocksoftware.com/?p=1303) on for the game Banished[^banished]. If you'd think on this, its rather logical to show the menu as fast as possible and to preload the latest savegame in background. And it's a great solution to show the scene from this latest save as a background for the main menu. And opening this save game would be instant and would mean just a slight transition from the main menu to the game interface.
